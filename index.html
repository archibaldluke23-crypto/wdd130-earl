            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                My practice is dedicated to the exploration of intricate
                abstract designs through pencil work, ballpoint pen drawings,
                etc. I also focus on photography in various genres including
                landscape, portraiture, commercial, etc. I am fundamentally
                driven by a desire to inspire others around me to take the
                time to capture the beauty of the world around us, as well
                as the joy and beauty that comes from each and every
                individual. My work seeks to offer viewers a moment
                of reflection, as well as inspiration and joy, 
                encouraging a deeper engagement with the often-overlooked
                details of the human experience.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The execution of my work is a meticulous journey that 
                prioritizes slow, fine lines and repeating patterns, as well 
                as framing, background, and other techniques in my digital 
                photography. I primarily utilize fine-tip pencils or mechanical 
                pencils, ballpoint pens, fine-tip pens, etc. for my traditional 
                art pieces, and using digital photography equipment such as a 
                DSLR camera, tripod, photoshop, etc. in my digital photography. 
                This deliberate choice of materials is central to the narrative, 
                often contrasting bold colors with black and white. Through my 
                artistic lens, I aim to not simply depict, but to more fully and 
                emotionally exhibit the complexities inherent in our personal 
                lives as well as all-in-all in the world around us.
